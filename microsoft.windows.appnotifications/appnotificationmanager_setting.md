# Microsoft.Windows.AppNotifications.AppNotificationManager.Setting

<!--
public Microsoft.Windows.AppNotifications.AppNotificationSetting Setting { get; }
-->

## -description

Get the app notification setting status for the app, determining whether notifications are currently enabled or, if not, the mechanism through which notifications are currently disabled.

> [!NOTE]
> The **AppNotificationManager** class has a dependency on the [Singleton package](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/deployment-architecture#singleton-package). Because of that dependency, there are certain considerations to be aware of if you're calling these APIs from a [self-contained app](/windows/apps/package-and-deploy/deploy-overview). For more info, and specifics, see [Dependencies on additional MSIX packages](/windows/apps/package-and-deploy/self-contained-deploy/deploy-self-contained-apps#dependencies-on-additional-msix-packages).

## -property-value
