# Microsoft.Windows.System.Power

## -description

Provides a set of power management APIs that allow visibility into how an app affects the device's power state, and enable the app to make intelligent decisions about resource usage. For example, an app might use this API to postpone resource-intensive background tasks while the device is running on battery power.

For more information, see [Power management with the app lifecycle API](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/applifecycle/applifecycle-power).
