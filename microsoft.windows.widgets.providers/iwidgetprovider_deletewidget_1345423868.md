# Microsoft.Windows.Widgets.Providers.IWidgetProvider.DeleteWidget(System.String,System.String)

<!--
public void DeleteWidget (string widgetId, string customState);
-->


## -description

Notifies the widget provider that one of the widgets it supports has been deleted, for example, when a user removes a widget from a widget host.

## -parameters

### -param widgetId

The unique identifier of the widget that is being unpinned. The widget ID value is dynamically generated by the <xref:Microsoft.Windows.Widgets.Providers.WidgetManager>. The widget ID remains the same for a widget from the moment of its creation until the moment the Widget is deleted. The widget ID is a unique value across all widgets and all widget providers. 

### -param customState

A string containing the custom state of the widget that has been unpinned.

## -remarks

As soon as this method has been called for a specific widget ID, your provider will not receive any other requests for that widget. At the time this method is called, using the deleted widget's Id to make any further calls on the methods of the <xref:Microsoft.Windows.Widgets.Providers.WidgetManager> will have no effect.
