# Microsoft.UI.Input.CharacterReceivedEventArgs

<!--
public sealed class CharacterReceivedEventArgs
-->

## -description

Contains event data for the [InputKeyboardSource.CharacterReceived](inputkeyboardsource_characterreceived.md) event.

## -remarks

Apps do not receive this event when an [Input Method Editor (IME)](/windows/apps/design/input/input-method-editors) is enabled. The Input Method Editor (IME) handles all keyboard input and sets [Handled](characterreceivedeventargs_handled.md) to true.
