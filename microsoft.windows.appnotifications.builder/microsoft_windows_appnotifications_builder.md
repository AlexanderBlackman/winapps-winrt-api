# Microsoft.Windows.AppNotifications.Builder



## -description

Provides APIs for programmatically generating the XML payload for an [AppNotification](xref:Microsoft.Windows.AppNotifications.AppNotification). 

## -remarks

App notifications are defined in an XML string. This namespace provides APIs that make it easy to generate the XML payload programmatically. This feature, which is included in the Windows App SDK, is designed to replace the functionality that was previously provided by the **ToastContentBuilder** class in the  UWP Community Toolkit Notifications nuget package.

For guidance on using the **AppNotificationBuilder** APIs to create the UI for app notifications, see [App notification content](/windows/apps/design/shell/tiles-and-notifications/adaptive-interactive-toasts).

For reference information about the XML schema for app notifications, see [App notification content schema](/windows/apps/design/shell/tiles-and-notifications/toast-schema).
