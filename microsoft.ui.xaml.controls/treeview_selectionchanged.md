# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.TreeView.SelectionChanged

<!--
public event Windows.Foundation.TypedEventHandler<Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.TreeView,Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.TreeViewSelectionChangedEventArgs> SelectionChanged;
-->

## -description

Occurs when there's a change to the items currently selected in the `TreeView`.

## -remarks

Handle the `TreeView.SelectionChanged` event to respond when the set of selected nodes in the `TreeView` control is changed either by a user or programmatically. The `TreeView` control raises this event in response to selection changing, which corresponds to changes in the [TreeView.SelectedItem](treeview_selecteditem.md), [TreeView.SelectedItems](treeview_selecteditems.md), and [TreeView.SelectedNodes](treeview_selectednodes.md) properties.
