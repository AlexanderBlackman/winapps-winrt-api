# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.ScrollView

<!--
public class ScrollView : Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.Control
-->

## -description

Represents a container that provides scroll, pan, and zoom support for its content.

## -remarks

The `ScrollView` control is similar in behavior and usage to the [ScrollViewer](scrollviewer.md) control, but is based on [InteractionTracker](../microsoft.ui.composition.interactions/interactiontracker.md), has new features such as animation-driven view changes, and is designed to ensure full functionality with [ItemsRepeater](itemsrepeater.md).
