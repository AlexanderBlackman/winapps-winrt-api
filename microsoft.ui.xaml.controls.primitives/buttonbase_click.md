# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase.Click

## -description
Occurs when a button control is clicked.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<buttonÂ Click="eventhandler"/>
```


## -remarks

There is also a [UIElement.Tapped](/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.uielement.tapped)
event that indicates that an element has been pressed and released with a pointer device, such as a mouse or touch.
However, we recommend that you use this `Click` event as a general purpose notification that the button has been clicked,
because it also responds to a button having been clicked with the keyboard or accessibility tools.


## -examples
The following example demonstrates handling the Click event and setting the [IsEnabled](../microsoft.ui.xaml.controls/control_isenabled.md) property of a [Button](../microsoft.ui.xaml.controls/button.md), which inherits from [ButtonBase](buttonbase.md).
