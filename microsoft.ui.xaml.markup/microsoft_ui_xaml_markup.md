# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Markup

## -description
Provides XAML language support API for UWP app and the Windows Runtime.

## -remarks
Many of the types in this namespace are infrastructure or types that support uncommon scenarios. But there is one type in this namespace that apps might use in more typical app scenarios.

+ [XamlReader](xamlreader.md) is a static class that can parse XAML and produce object trees. This class enables run-time access to the Windows Runtime XAML parser, the same parser that's used when XAML UI definition pages are parsed into object representations when an app starts. You can then connect the generated object tree to other existing UI elements and make the new objects appear in your UI.
