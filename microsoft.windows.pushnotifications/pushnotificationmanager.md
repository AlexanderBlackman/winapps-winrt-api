# Microsoft.Windows.PushNotifications.PushNotificationManager

<!--
public sealed class PushNotificationManager
-->

## -description

Provides APIs for receiving and registering to receive push notifications.

> [!NOTE]
> The **PushNotificationManager** class has a dependency on the [Singleton package](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/deployment-architecture#singleton-package). Because of that dependency, there are certain considerations to be aware of if you're calling these APIs from a [self-contained app](/windows/apps/package-and-deploy/deploy-overview). For more info, and specifics, see [Dependencies on additional MSIX packages](/windows/apps/package-and-deploy/self-contained-deploy/deploy-self-contained-apps#dependencies-on-additional-msix-packages).

## -remarks

Get an instance of this class by accessing the [PushNotificationManager.Default](xref:Microsoft.Windows.PushNotifications.PushNotificationManager.Default) property.
